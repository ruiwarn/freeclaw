# FreeClaw Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

**Version 1.0 — February 2026**  
**FreeClaw Labs**

---

## Purpose

This Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") clarifies the intellectual
property rights granted by contributors to FreeClaw Labs. This agreement
protects both contributors and users of the FreeClaw project.

By submitting a contribution (pull request, patch, issue with code, or any
other form of code submission) to the FreeClaw repository, you agree to the
terms of this CLA.

---

## 1. Definitions

- **"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any
  modifications or additions to existing work, submitted to FreeClaw Labs
  for inclusion in the FreeClaw project.

- **"You"** means the individual or legal entity submitting a Contribution.

- **"FreeClaw Labs"** means the maintainers and organization responsible
  for the FreeClaw project at https://github.com/ruiwarn/freeclaw.

---

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

You grant FreeClaw Labs and recipients of software distributed by FreeClaw
Labs a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable copyright license to:

- Reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
  perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions and derivative
  works under **both the MIT License and the Apache License 2.0**.

---

## 3. Grant of Patent License

You grant FreeClaw Labs and recipients of software distributed by FreeClaw
Labs a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
import, and otherwise transfer your Contributions.

This patent license applies only to patent claims licensable by you that
are necessarily infringed by your Contribution alone or in combination with
the FreeClaw project.

**This protects you:** if a third party files a patent claim against
FreeClaw that covers your Contribution, your patent license to the project
is not revoked.

---

## 4. You Retain Your Rights

This CLA does **not** transfer ownership of your Contribution to FreeClaw
Labs. You retain full copyright ownership of your Contribution. You are
free to use your Contribution in any other project under any license.

---

## 5. Original Work

You represent that:

1. Each Contribution is your original creation, or you have sufficient
   rights to submit it under this CLA.
2. Your Contribution does not knowingly infringe any third-party patent,
   copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right.
3. If your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you
   have received permission to submit the Contribution, or your employer
   has signed a corporate CLA with FreeClaw Labs.

---

## 6. No Trademark Rights

This CLA does not grant you any rights to use the FreeClaw name,
trademarks, service marks, or logos. See TRADEMARK.md for trademark policy.

---

## 7. Attribution

FreeClaw Labs will maintain attribution to contributors in the repository
commit history and NOTICE file. Your contributions are permanently and
publicly recorded.

---

## 8. Dual-License Commitment

All Contributions accepted into the FreeClaw project are licensed under
both:

- **MIT License** — permissive open-source use
- **Apache License 2.0** — patent protection and stronger IP guarantees

This dual-license model ensures maximum compatibility and protection for
the entire contributor community.

---

## 9. How to Agree

By opening a pull request or submitting a patch to the FreeClaw repository,
you indicate your agreement to this CLA. No separate signature is required
for individual contributors.

For **corporate contributors** (submitting on behalf of a company or
organization), please open an issue titled "Corporate CLA — [Company Name]"
and a maintainer will follow up.
