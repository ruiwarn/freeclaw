"FreeClaw" or implying affiliation with FreeClaw Labs is unauthorized and
may constitute trademark infringement.

## Permitted Uses

You **may** use the FreeClaw name and marks in the following ways without
prior written permission:

1. **Attribution** — stating that your software is based on or derived from
   FreeClaw, provided it is clear your project is not the official FreeClaw.

2. **Descriptive reference** — referring to FreeClaw in documentation,
   articles, blog posts, or presentations to accurately describe the software.

3. **Community discussion** — using the name in forums, issues, or social
   media to discuss the project.

4. **Fork identification** — identifying your fork as "a fork of FreeClaw"
   with a clear link to the official repository.

## Prohibited Uses

You **may not** use the FreeClaw name or marks in ways that:

1. **Imply official endorsement** — suggest your project, product, or
   organization is officially affiliated with or endorsed by FreeClaw Labs.

2. **Cause brand confusion** — use "FreeClaw" as the primary name of a
   competing or derivative product in a way that could confuse users about
   the source.

3. **Impersonate the project** — create repositories, domains, packages,
   or accounts that could be mistaken for the official FreeClaw project.

4. **Misrepresent origin** — remove or obscure attribution to FreeClaw Labs
   while distributing the software or derivatives.

5. **Commercial trademark use** — use the marks in commercial products,
   services, or marketing without prior written permission from FreeClaw Labs.
